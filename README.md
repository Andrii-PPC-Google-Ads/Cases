Launched:
1. Branded
2. Competitors
3. General queries
4. Remarketing
5. Google Shopping

Very big competition.
For all the time of work (started from scratch), got 963 conversions
(call, order on the site) at a price of 90 UAH. In May 2022, came to 12 orders per day. Now the competition has become even more . There is an active struggle with competitors who copy our site and use our brand.
Google has already kicked out two of them. It remains to finish the last one.

<h1><b>Building materials</b></h1>

![Строительные материалы копия](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113106509/189109447-7bb3a792-46a4-45c7-862a-4eb81854829f.png)

The niche is seasonal. By winter, demand tends to drop. The competition is extremely high.

Launched:
1. Google Shopping on bricks, cinder blocks, tiles, concrete. There's no point in touching the bulk material.
It makes no sense to touch it (it is already taken as a load).
2. General queries.
3. Branded.
4. Remarketing.

The goal was to increase sales, which was already achieved in August 2021 and to boost sales even more before the cold weather hits in October 2021.
After the end of active hostilities in Kyiv and the region, gradually reached the same level of sales. By August 2022, sales reached last year's level.

<h1><b>Lawyer Services</b></h1>

Launched:
1. Search Ads
2. Remarketing
3. Discovery

The lead is the call and sending of the form. The bulk of the bids was from the Discovery campaign. All other leads came from search ads and remarketing.
Even though the niche is marginally competitive, users don't really trust lawyers and look for more information on third-party sites. I made a list of sites for placement and added them to ads (which give more leads).

<h1><b>Stationery</b></h1>

The client is a small stationery store. Competition
high.
Launched:
1. Google Shopping on the most popular products in the niche (paper,
notepads, pens, etc.).
2. Search ads for general queries (buy paper).
3. Branding.
4. Remarketing (who have already bought, not completed the purchase, looked
a certain product).
5. From the new year planned to launch Discovery.
